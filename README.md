# Efficient-Algorithm

## About The Project
This repository contains a collection of efficient and optimized algorithms for solving various programming problems. The aim of this project is to provide quick and reliable solutions to common challenges in data science, software engineering, and related fields.

## Getting Started
To use these algorithms in your projects, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/efficient-algorithm.git
```
Then, you can import the desired files into your project.

### How To Use
For each algorithm, a simple example of how to use it is provided in the respective files. For instance:

```
const { findLongestSubstring } = require('./algorithms/longest-substring');

const inputString = "learningisfun";
console.log(findLongestSubstring(inputString)); // Output: 'learni'
```
